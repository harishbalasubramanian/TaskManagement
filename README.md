# TaskManagement
Thank you so much for clicking here, here is what this app does:
1. This project helps people account for their tasks and makes task management easy. It is a full stack web app that uses the MERN tech stack which is MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS.
Furthermore, for state management, it uses React Redux for the management. This app allows users to create accounts and log in 
2. For frontend, I included components and mobile responsitveness. There are limited animations on this though I didn't expand as much.
   For backend I have user registration, login, and logout, API calls (as I have an API for logging in and for task management) and I included database integrations as well. Also, I included objects as well in this.
   For full-stack I included a framework for linking frontend with backend (I used React with Node)
   For Miscellaneous, I included Redux for state management, included middleware for db and backend connections. Furthermore, I included hashing for passwords and used modules/files to separate out code to make it much more readable.
3. I spent about 4 or 5 hours making this project.
